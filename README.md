# Dynatrace_AWS_Monitoring

**Enabling access to your Amazon account using key-based access**

Dynatrace can use access keys to make secure REST or Query protocol requests to the AWS service API. You'll need to generate an Access key ID and a Secret access key that Dynatrace can use to get metrics from Amazon Web Services.
